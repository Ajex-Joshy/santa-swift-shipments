# 🎅 Santa Swift Shipments

Santa Swift Shipments is a modern, scalable logistics dashboard application designed to simulate and visualize global shipment deliveries.  
The project is inspired by real-world logistics platforms and is themed around Santa’s global gift delivery operations.

This repository currently focuses on the **frontend foundation**, built with a fast, type-safe stack, and is designed to evolve into a **full-fledged logistics tracking and optimization system**.
